# Genius Parser

Script for scraping, little pre-proccessing and collecting lyrics in txt file by artist's genius url
Pre-proccessing works both with ru & en languages

It has been configured for Kendrick Lamar's lyrics, there is the result in lyrics.txt.
To change artist you need to paste url of genius page of artist you're intrested in main.py file.



Unfortunatly when I've been writing this code it was for band with just 5 albums, so after posting code I found out it's collecting just up to top 6 albums.

I know that's kinda stupid, but mb I'll fix this later
